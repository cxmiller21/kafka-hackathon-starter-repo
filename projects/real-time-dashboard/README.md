# Kafka Real-time Analytics Dashboard

Create a real-time analytics dashboard that displays some kind of data

## Goals

- [ ] Pick a type of data to display
  - Example: Weather data, stock data, website activity, etc.
- [ ] Create a Kafka producer that sends data to a topic
  - Example: Java/Python application or script that sends data to a topic
- [ ] Create a Kafka consumer that reads the data from a topic
  - Example: Build a Java/Python application to read data from the topic and display it in a dashboard
  - Look into using a library like [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/minimal-app) to create the dashboard
  - Look into using streams to update events
